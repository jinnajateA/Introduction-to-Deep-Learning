# Peer-graded Assignment: Week 5: GANs

## Introduction: Stylizing Images with GANs Inspired by Monet

In this project, we explore how artificial intelligence—specifically *Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)*—can be applied to replicate the distinct artistic style of Claude Monet. 

By training a GAN model on Monet’s artwork, our goal is to generate new images that reflect the impressionistic textures, colors, and brushwork found in his masterpieces. This effort combines the power of:

- **AI and Deep Learning**: Leveraging neural networks to understand and mimic artistic patterns.
- **Computer Vision**: Interpreting and generating image content.
- **Art and Creativity**: Translating classical painting techniques into generative digital art.

## Problem Definition: Monet-Style Image Generation Using GANs

The goal of this project is to design and train a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** that can produce a large collection—between 7,000 and 10,000—of images that convincingly reflect the artistic style of Claude Monet.

A GAN consists of two core neural networks:

- **Generator**: Learns to create images that imitate Monet’s impressionistic style.
- **Discriminator**: Acts as a critic, trying to distinguish between real Monet paintings and synthetic images generated by the model.

These two models are trained in a competitive framework:
- The **generator** tries to fool the discriminator by generating realistic Monet-style images.
- The **discriminator** tries to correctly classify images as either real (authentic Monet) or fake (generated by the model).
